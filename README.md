ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Hi! My name is Vithoria, and Iâ€™m a Computer Engineering student at UTFPR. Currently, I work as a Product Owner, where I help bridge business needs with development teams, ensuring that the solutions delivered provide real value.
Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and always looking to improve my skills, both in technical development and agile management (Scrum, Kanban). I enjoy understanding how technology can be used strategically to solve problems and improve processes.
